lunarexpdesc:0 "After an upbringing in an upper middle class family from the Vaverfront countryside, everyone thought Lunar had accomplished his dream of becoming an airship pilot. What he didn't tell them, though, was that he was piloting for the Olenian Military. The colorful uniforms and accolades had drawn him into the service, but it was the supplementary pay and thrill that came from carrying a few "unlisted" packages through borders that truly made it worth it.\n\nLunar was clever enough that he was never caught, with the right balance of (only half) feigned naivety and ineptitude, actual skill and knowledge, cajolery, half truths and lies, and plausible believability. When King Johan took over, things only got easier. He was given command of a small airship of his own, and now had an excuse to take even more lucrative, if dangerous shipments into Olenia. Demand for less-than-legal equipment at less-than-fair rates was high from the Harmonic rebels, as well as Johan's own regime. Each assumed he was acting on their own behalf, and he never had any trouble from either.\n\nThings were heating up with the Changelings though, and while he might have enjoyed the war, Olenia was weak, and he didn't want to be stuck under a commander that supervised their soldiers closely, lest he be forced into a suicidal tactic he couldn't sneak away from. So, Lunar took his ship on an "extended tour" around the world, engaging in more questionable acts and adventures from the Forbidden Jungles to the plains of Zebrica.\n\nLunar eventually wound up in Griffonstone. He still claims he has been uncontacted by command, and he still sends postcards and the odd gift or two to his parents, who still think he's just an airship pilot."
